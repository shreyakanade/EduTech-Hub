E-commerce Clothing Shop - Angular
This project is an elegant and responsive e-commerce application built with Angular, designed for browsing and purchasing clothing items. It offers a seamless shopping experience with features commonly found in modern online stores, focusing on a clean UI and efficient data handling.

Features
Product Catalog: Browse a wide range of clothing items with detailed descriptions and images.

Product Filtering & Sorting: Easily filter products by category, size, color, and sort them by price, popularity, etc.

Product Details Page: View individual product details, including multiple images, pricing, availability, and customer reviews.

Shopping Cart: Add, update, and remove items from the cart.

Checkout Process: A streamlined multi-step checkout flow (simulated, as a backend is not included in this frontend-only demo).

User Authentication (Placeholder): Basic user registration and login forms (frontend only, no actual authentication logic or backend integration for security).

Responsive Design: Optimized for a consistent experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Search Functionality: Quickly find products by name or keywords.

Technologies Used
Angular: The core framework for building a dynamic single-page application.

TypeScript: Provides type safety and enhances code quality.

Angular CLI: For scaffolding, developing, and building Angular applications.

RxJS: For reactive programming and managing asynchronous data streams.

HTML5 & CSS3 (with SASS/SCSS): For structuring and styling the application.

Tailwind CSS (or Bootstrap/Material Design, depending on choice): For responsive and utility-first styling.

JSON Server (for mock API): Used for quick local development and simulating a backend API.

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

(Optional) Set up a mock API with JSON Server if you plan to extend functionality locally without a real backend:

# Create a db.json file with your mock data
# Start JSON Server:
# json-server --watch db.json

Usage
To run the application in development mode:

ng serve

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

ng build

The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
